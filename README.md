# Hour of Code Demonstration

This was a 3 hour session prepared for high school students at the Blackstone Academy. They were introduced to object-oriented programming, binary/hexidecimal numbers, computer hardware architecture, and basic principles of webpage design. The focus was geared towards understanding the fundamentals of programming using the Cloud 9 IDE and Python language.

The files included were 4 programs I created to illustrate core concepts.
